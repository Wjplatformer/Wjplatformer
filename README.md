- 👋 Hi, I’m @Wjplatformer
- 👀 I’m interested in Networking and databases on Python and C++. (sockets, server and clients, flask web dev, pandas, SQL)
-  😁Currently learning C++ Classes and doing a chat app in Python
-  You can reach me on github, I may be able to answer some questions for python learners. But I advise not to find me because most people in github are pros and I am a Noob😶
